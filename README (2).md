## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using SQL and Power BI. The data was extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) using SQL queries, and then visualized through interactive dashboards in Power BI.

### 1. Data Analysis with SQL

- All key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics were prepared using SQL.
- SQL scripts were used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
- The sql file contains all SQL queries written for:
    - Data extraction from the source.
    - Data cleaning and transformation to prepare it for analysis.
    - Generating KPIs such as Total sales, Average Order Value,Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders .

### 2. Dashboards & Visualizations with Power BI
- The `pizza_sales_report.pbix` Power BI file contains interactive dashboards designed based on SQL query outputs.
- Power BI was used to create various visualizations, including:
    - Sales trends over time.
    - Product performance charts.
    - Key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick insights.
- Top 5 and Bottom 5 Pizzas: The second page includes specific visualizations for:
    - Top 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.
    - Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.
- Dynamic Navigation: The report includes two pages with dynamic navigation buttons ("Home" and "Best/Worst Sellers") to easily switch between different views.
- The dashboards allow for dynamic filtering and drill-down    capabilities to explore the data.
